# Client Side JavaScript SandBox

## Motivation

This is just a personal collection of generally stand-a-lone web pages that
test or experiment with Client Side JavaScript.

## Organisation

The directory `www` is the webroot directory which can be dropped into a web
server to execute the various scripts.
